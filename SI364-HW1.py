## PART 1 - 100 points

## First, set up a new-to-this-assignment virtual environment. To the Canvas assignment, you should submit:
# - A screenshot showing your virtual environment activated and deactivated. You should feel comfortable activating and deactivating a virtual environment. ## NOTE: (You can call the virtualenv whatever you want, but remember you'll have to type it a lot and we will have to see it. It's not like a password -- consider it public.) 
# - You should have installed the flask library and the requests library in the virtual environment. You should submit to this Canvas assignment a screenshot that shows the result of typing _ pip freeze _ at the command prompt with the virtual environment activated.

## [PROBLEM 1] - 150 points
## Below is code for one of the simplest possible Flask applications. Edit the code so that once you run this application locally and go to the URL 'http://localhost:5000/class', you see a page that says "Welcome to SI 364!" 

from flask import Flask
app = Flask(__name__)
app.debug = True

@app.route('/')
def hello_to_you():
    return 'Hello!'


if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run()


## [PROBLEM 2] - 250 points
## Edit the code chunk above again so that if you go to the URL 'http://localhost:5000/movie/<name-of-movie-here-one-word>' you see a big dictionary of data on the page. For example, if you go to the URL 'http://localhost:5000/movie/ratatouille', you should seesomething like the data shown in the included file sample_ratatouille_data.txt, which contains data about the animated movie Ratatouille. However, if you go to the url http://localhost:5000/movie/titanic, you should get different data, and if you go to the url 'http://localhost:5000/movie/dsagdsgskfsl' for example, you should see data on the page that looks like this:

# {
#  "resultCount":0,
#  "results": []
# }


## You should use the iTunes Search API to get that data. 
## Docs for that API are here: https://affiliate.itunes.apple.com/resources/documentation/itunes-store-web-service-search-api/
## Of course, you'll also need the requests library and knowledge of how to make a request to a REST API for data. 

## Run the app (repeatedly) and try these URLs out!
